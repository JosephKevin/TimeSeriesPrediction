The objectives of this project is to 
1. Visualize sensor data
	Locate the table called “exec” and plot the following data points as a time-series chart: “depth”, “rate1s”, and “rate5s”. The time value is in the “ts” column. Note that the values for “rate1s” and “rate5s” are embedded in a JSON dictionary in the “rate” column of the table. 
	Locate the table called “tcplife” and plot the following data columns as time series plots and their histograms:  “rx”, “tx”, “dur”, “lport”, and “rport”.

2. Data Statics
	Perform a study of descriptive statistics of 'dur' values in the 'tcplife' table.
